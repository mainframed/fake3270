# FAKE TN3270

This is a fake TN3270 generator. Used to make fake tn3270 streams to
help me make art.

## Requirements:

Needs tn3270 lib (https://github.com/zedsec390/tn3270lib) to run

## Notes:

This is fairly barebones. Ideally you can read this guide
(http://www.tommysprinkle.com/mvs/P3270/index.htm) to understand tn3270
datastreams then edit fake3270.py line 72 to add your own TN3270 data.
